# Predict Bike Sharing Demand using AutoGluon
AutoGluon enables easy-to-use and easy-to-extend AutoML with a focus on automated stack ensembling, deep learning, and real-world applications spanning text, image, and tabular data.

1. In this project Kaggle is used for loading the data and the project is a competition on kaggle so the output is also submitted on kaggle.
2. In project the new features were added and hyperparameter tuning is performed for making more accurate predictions. 
3. The Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was also performed for describing the data by means of statistical and visualization techniques in order to bring important aspects of that data into focus for further analysis.
